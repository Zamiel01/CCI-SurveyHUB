# CCI SurveyHUB

> Create. Collect. Verify. Analyse.

A web application designed for the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) to centralise 
the creation, distribution, collection and analysis of business surveys.

---

## Project Overview

CCI SurveyHUB was built to solve a real data management problem observed during an 
internship at the CCI. Survey responses were scattered across multiple Excel files, 
company records contained missing or invalid data, and analysis was slow and unreliable.

This application brings everything into one place:
- Create structured surveys with blocks and multiple-choice questions
- Share surveys with companies through a public link
- Automatically detect data quality issues on submission
- Visualise results through a simple dashboard
- Export clean data to CSV or Excel for Power BI reporting
